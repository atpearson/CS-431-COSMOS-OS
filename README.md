# CS-431-COSMOS-OS
OS created on top of the COSMOS framework.
The way some things are implemented may be a little convoluted due to the lack of support for many basic functions and structures within COSOMOS such as queues, switch statements, etc. not being fully implemented.  Additionally this is the final version in which I had to condense some classes down into the large commands class due to the professor setting a limit on the amount of classes that could be used prior to final turnin.  I no longer have my previous uncondensed versions saved on my computer.  Finally due to the fact that this was a large solo project with limited time, I have not implemented very much error checking because it was not a requirement.  Due to that the OS will crash in most instances where input is not in the proper format.
